# NeoPatterns

This is technically a fork of the [NeoPatterns](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-3/overview) library
from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com). I say *technically* because the original library was not posted on github to be forked.

I re-factored it a fair bit to make it more easy to extend and use. In particular, I separated the patterns
from the shared code to control the NeoPixel lights. I also added a few more patterns.
