The original NeoPatterns library carries no explicit license text, so I assert that its legal status is uncertain.

Any modifications made to it by me are hereby licensed entirely free under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Here is the quick summary of it:

*This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.*
